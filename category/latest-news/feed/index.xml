										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The officers involved in the fatal shooting of a black motorist during an attempted arrest in North Carolina will not face criminal charges.</strong></p>



<p>The Elizabeth City District Attorney told reporters the police shooting of Andrew Brown, 42, was &#8220;justified&#8221;.</p>



<p>Officials say Mr Brown drove his car at police during the 44-second encounter.</p>



<p>Mr Brown&#8217;s family disagree with authorities, and say he was &#8220;executed&#8221;. An independent inquiry found he was shot five times, including in the back.</p>



<p>His death on 21 April sparked protests against police brutality, and comes at a time of heightened scrutiny over the use of lethal police force on African-Americans.</p>



<h2>What did the district attorney say?</h2>



<p>In a news conference on Tuesday, District Attorney Andrew Womble said Mr Brown &#8220;posed an immediate threat to the safety of the officers&#8221; when he ignored commands and tried to evade arrest, using his car as a &#8220;deadly weapon&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;I find that the facts of this case clearly illustrate the officers who used deadly force on Andrew Brown Jr did so reasonably and only when a violent felon used a deadly weapon to place their lives in danger,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Constitution simply does not require police to gamble with their lives in the face of a serious threat of harm.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added that Mr Brown was being served with felony and search warrants, and &#8220;they could not simply let him go as has been suggested&#8221;.</p>



<p>The district attorney also noted that none of the deputies involved in the incident had prior excessive force complaints.</p>



<p>When questioned over Mr Brown&#8217;s intentions, Mr Womble said even though he believes Mr Brown was just trying to flee, &#8220;he had no choice but to drive at the officers&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;When he did that, and he made that decision on his own, he placed their lives in danger.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mr Womble said he held Tuesday&#8217;s briefing in order to be transparent, given the high profile nature of the case. He defended his decision to not release information earlier, saying it was part of the normal legal process.</p>



<p>No officers were injured in the incident, which took place outside Mr Brown&#8217;s Elizabeth City home, Mr Womble said. Of the 14 shots fired at the vehicle, he noted one appeared to have ricocheted and was found in a nearby house.</p>



<p>Mr Womble told reporters he had not spoken with Mr Brown&#8217;s family ahead of the news conference. He said there were &#8220;barriers&#8221; in speaking with the family and their counsel.</p>



<p>&#8220;In all honesty we could&#8217;ve done a better job to repair that relationship prior to this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s unfortunate and I don&#8217;t like the way it played out.&#8221;</p>

</div></figure>



<p>An Israeli air strike in Gaza destroyed several homes on Sunday, killing 42 Palestinians, including 10 children, health officials said, as militants fired rockets at Israel&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-chief-says-israel-gaza-fighting-utterly-appalling-2021-05-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with no end in sight to seven days of fighting</a>.</p>



<p>The Israeli military said the civilian casualties were unintentional. It said its jets attacked a tunnel system used by militants, which collapsed, bringing the homes down.</p>



<p>Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, called it &#8220;pre-meditated killing&#8221;.</p>



<p>As the U.N. Security Council convened to discuss the worst Israeli-Palestinian violence in years, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel&#8217;s campaign in Gaza was continuing at &#8220;full force&#8221;.</p>



<p>Netanyahu also defended an Israeli air strike on Saturday that destroyed a 12-storey building where the Associated Press and the Al Jazeera TV network had offices. He said the structure also housed a militant group&#8217;s intelligence office and was thus a legitimate target.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are acting now, (and) for as long as necessary, to restore calm and quiet to you, Israel&#8217;s citizens. It will take time,&#8221; Netanyahu said in a televised address after meeting with his security cabinet.</p>



<p>The death toll in Gaza jumped to 192, including 58 children, its health ministry said, amid an intensive Israeli air and artillery barrage since the fighting erupted last Monday.</p>



<p>Ten people have been killed in Israel, including two children, Israeli authorities say.</p>

<p>Israel-Palestine Conflict Highlights: Speaking at the UN Security Council meeting, India’s Permanent Representative reiterated support for a &#8216;two-state solution&#8217;.</p>
</div></div>



<p><strong>Israel-Palestine Conflict Highlights:</strong> The conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants continues to escalate. Israeli fighter jets unleashed a series of heavy airstrikes at multiple locations in Gaza City earlier today. This came hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signaled the fourth war with Gaza&#8217;s Hamas rulers would rage on. Hamas also pressed on, launching rockets from civilian areas in Gaza toward civilian areas in Israel. Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza, launched the rocket attacks last week, in retaliation for Israeli police clashes with Palestinians near al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam&#8217;s third holiest site, in East Jerusalem. According to Israel’s defence forces, more than 2,000 rockets had been fired from Gaza into Israel since the start of the conflict, around half of them intercepted by the ‘Iron Dome’ air defence systems. Civil unrest between Jews and Arabs in Israel itself dealt a strong blow to efforts by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#8217;s opponents to unseat the Israeli leader after a series of inconclusive elections, giving rise to expectations that Israelis will go to the polls for an unprecedented fifth time in just over two years.</p>
