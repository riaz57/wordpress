An independent inquiry found he was shot five times, including in the back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His death on 21 April sparked protests against police brutality, and comes at a time of heightened scrutiny over the use of lethal police force on African-Americans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What did the district attorney say?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a news conference on Tuesday, District Attorney Andrew Womble said Mr Brown &#8220;posed an immediate threat to the safety of the officers&#8221; when he ignored commands and tried to evade arrest, using his car as a &#8220;deadly weapon&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I find that the facts of this case clearly illustrate the officers who used deadly force on Andrew Brown Jr did so reasonably and only when a violent felon used a deadly weapon to place their lives in danger,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Constitution simply does not require police to gamble with their lives in the face of a serious threat of harm.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that Mr Brown was being served with felony and search warrants, and &#8220;they could not simply let him go as has been suggested&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The district attorney also noted that none of the deputies involved in the incident had prior excessive force complaints.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When questioned over Mr Brown&#8217;s intentions, Mr Womble said even though he believes Mr Brown was just trying to flee, &#8220;he had no choice but to drive at the officers&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When he did that, and he made that decision on his own, he placed their lives in danger.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr Womble said he held Tuesday&#8217;s briefing in order to be transparent, given the high profile nature of the case. He defended his decision to not release information earlier, saying it was part of the normal legal process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No officers were injured in the incident, which took place outside Mr Brown&#8217;s Elizabeth City home, Mr Womble said. Of the 14 shots fired at the vehicle, he noted one appeared to have ricocheted and was found in a nearby house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr Womble told reporters he had not spoken with Mr Brown&#8217;s family ahead of the news conference. He said there were &#8220;barriers&#8221; in speaking with the family and their counsel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In all honesty we could&#8217;ve done a better job to repair that relationship prior to this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s unfortunate and I don&#8217;t like the way it played out.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The officers involved in the fatal shooting of a black motorist during an attempted arrest in North Carolina will not<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":537,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5,7,9],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/533"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=533"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/533\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":535,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/533\/revisions\/535"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/537"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=533"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=533"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=533"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
